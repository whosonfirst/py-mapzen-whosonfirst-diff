# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-diff

Python tools for managing differences in Who's On First documents

**STOP** - this is nowhere near ready for use. Also the package and function names are dull and uninspired. That said this library _should_ eventually:

* Return a sane and reasonably portable (and compact) text-based diff
* Indicate which keys in a pair of GeoJSON files have changed
* Indicated whether changes to the newer of two files should propagate to others and who (in the abstract, like "children", "adjacent", etc.)
